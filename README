- Aim of Project

Aim of project is to practise end-to-end testing by testing of previous javascript-basics logic through an Express API. Tests have been updated and the aim is to write the routes with express to pass the tests.

The original JavaScript logic lives in `src/lib/` and is reused withthout updating.
New tests have been added that make HTTP requests to an Express app using Supertest.

The task is to write the correct Express routes in `src/app.js` so that each one:

- responds to the correct HTTP method and path
- returns the correct HTTP status code
- returns the expected JSON response

This allows the same logic to be tested end-to-end:
request → route → logic → response.
